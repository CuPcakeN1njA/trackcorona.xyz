Documentation can be found at [https://trackcorona.xyz](here).

All of the information in this API comes from the World Health Organisation and I parse the daily situation reports into the CSV files which get queried.

I am hosting this my self and if you would like to support this API you can donate [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KUQSESWLVN2VU&source=url](here)
